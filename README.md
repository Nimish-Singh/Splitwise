## Rules followed

- [x] Formatted code. (2 space tabs recommended. Otherwise consistency most important overall)
- [x] Code should be working, ie one should be able to execute it and get desired output for at least all mentioned samples cases.
- [x] You should have unit test which make it clear the code is working when all unit tests pass.
- [x] Code should be submitted with appropriate instructions on how to execute(and dependencies) if any required.
- [x] Code should be submitted before the allotted time. Commits before this time will be considered. Thus a Git repo is mandatory with multiple commits indicating incremental effort.
- [x] Guard Clause. No else keyword.
- [x] There should be no `return true`, `return false` if the expression can be returned directly.
- [x] All classes should have a good "Understands" message
- [x] No comments or empty lines in the code base.
- [x] Follow java naming conventions for variables, methods, classes and packages.
- [x] Good commit messages and concise commits. Each commit has changes and tests for those changes.
- [x] No magic numbers and strings floating around.
- [x] Having a ReadMe for your code with whatever you deem helps the evaluator.
- [ ] Methods should not be longer than 6 lines of code.
- [x] Class should not have more than 6 methods.
